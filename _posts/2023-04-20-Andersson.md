 In this talk I will discuss the dynamical role of superfluidity in neutron stars, motivating why we expect these objects to be superfluid in the first place and outlining how superfluidity impacts on the hydrodynamics of the system. In particular, I will compare and contrast neutron-star superfluids with laboratory systems. This naturally leads on to a discussion of how we are trying to use astronomical observations to probe the relevant superfluid parameters and the current understanding of the pulsar glitch phenomenon.
