Prof Jeevak Parpia (Cornell University) gives a webinar on "Path-Dependent Supercooling of the <sup>3</sup>He Superfluid A-B transition" at 4pm UK time.

We have observed the discontinuous first-order superfluid <sup>3</sup>He A to B transition in the vicinity of the polycritical point (2.232 mK and 21.22 bar). We find path-dependent transitions in a small-volume bulk sample: cooling at fixed pressure yields a well defined transition line in the temperature-pressure plane, but this line can be reliably crossed by depressurizing at nearly constant temperature after transiting T<sub>c</sub> at a higher pressure. This path dependence is not consistent with any of the standard B-phase nucleation mechanisms in the literature.
