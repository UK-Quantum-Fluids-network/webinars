The static and dynamic properties of vortices in dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates (dBECs) can be considerably modified relative to their nondipolar counterparts by the anisotropic and long-ranged nature of the dipole-dipole interaction (DDI). In the context of a uniform, three-dimensional dBEC, I will present recent results on the structure of single vortex lines and the dynamics of pairs of vortices across a range of scenarios. For a single vortex, by isolating the effects of the  DDI from those of external trapping, I demonstrate intrinsic differences in its density and phase structure owing to the effective interaction between the core and the bulk. These discrepancies can be controlled by tuning the parameters that pertain to the DDI. The ramifications of this are then elucidated for the dynamics of pairs of straight vortex lines, where both same-signed vortex-vortex trajectories and opposite-signed vortex-vortex translational velocities are demonstrated to diverge from the point-vortex paradigm in a dipole-dependent manner. I will also discuss preliminary results on the reconnection dynamics of a pair of vortex lines, where the influence of the DDI on the curvature of the vortices results in dipole-mediated reconnection times and post-reconnection vortex structures. These findings open the door to a deeper understanding of the mechanisms that underlie many-vortex phenomena in dipolar superfluids such as vortex lattice dynamics and quantum turbulence, and could be studied experimentally in optically generated three-dimensional box-trapping potentials.
