A classical system can have multiple equilibrium states at different energies; the absolute ground state is a
stable configuration, while the other local energy minima are metastable. In a quantum field theory, quantum
fluctuations can trigger the macroscopic tunneling of the field from a metastable state (the false vacuum) to
the ground state (true vacuum) through the many-body energy barrier [1]. The decay of a false vacuum,
which is thought to manifest via the nucleation of spatially localized bubbles of true vacuum, is a fascinating
phenomena for a rich variety of systems, ranging from condensed matter [2] to cosmology [3]. Nevertheless,
its experimental verification has been elusive so far, due to the extreme energy scales involved and the lack of
tunable parameters. Here, I will present the first experimental evidence of false vacuum decay in a metastable
ferromagnetic superfluid [4]. In this novel platform, realized with ultracold sodium atoms [5], the superfluid
acts as the quantum field, and macroscopic tunneling events are observed through the spontaneous nucleation
of spin bubbles. Our results find good agreement with numerical simulations and instanton theory, opening the
way for the simulation of out-of-equilibrium phenomena in a highly controllable and tunable atomic system.
