Topological defects are classified by the order parameter space of the
considered system in the ground state.

Although the global or external structure of a defect is determined
typically by the homotopy theory, the internal structure in the "core" of defects can be nontrivial by
some sort of energy hierarchy in the presence of a characteristic
length scale in addition to the healing length of the bulk order
parameter.

This aspect of topological defects has not been well known but is
important since the internal structure can change static and dynamic
properties of defects drastically.

Here, we show an important, timely example of such systems, the polar
phase of spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates with easy-axis nematic
order, and discuss mainly on our recent contiributions [1-4].
