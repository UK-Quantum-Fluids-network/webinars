Dr Hans Keßler (Universität Hamburg) talks about "Dissipative time crystals in an atom-cavity platform".


Time crystals are classified as discrete or continuous depending on whether they spontaneously break discrete or continuous time translation symmetry. While discrete time crystals have been extensively studied in periodically driven systems since their recent discovery, the experimental realisation of a continuous time crystal [1,2] was still pending. We report the observation of a limit cycle phase in a continuously pumped dissipative atom-cavity system [3], which is characterised by emergent oscillations in the intracavity photon number. We observe that the phase of this oscillation is random for different realisations, and hence this dynamical many-body state breaks continuous time translation symmetry spontaneously. The observed robustness of the limit cycles against temporal perturbations confirms the realisation of a continuous time crystal. Moreover, if we modulate the pump field of our atom-cavity system periodically we observe discrete time crystalline dynamics [4].
