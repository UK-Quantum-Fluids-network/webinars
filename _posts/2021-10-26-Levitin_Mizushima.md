Dr. Levitin (4pm)
"Search for Cooper pair density waves in superfluid helium 3"

Confinement on a lengthscale comparable to the superfluid coherence length is a powerful tool for modifying the order parameter of the p-wave superfluid 3He via anisotropic surface pairbreaking. A stripe phase has been predicted in slab geometry, comprised of domains of Balian-Werthamer phase with alternating sign of one of the order parameter components. This superfluid with a broken translational symmetry is both a Cooper pair density wave (PDW) and a supersolid. I report on nuclear magnetic resonance experiments in superfluid 3He confined to 1 micron slab, probing the spatially-averaged order parameter amplitudes, sensitive to such domains. The stripe phase with equal amount of + and - domains was not observed, instead there is evidence for a spatially modulated phase with unequal amounts of the two types of domains. I will discuss the possible origins of such imbalance, consistent with a "polka dot" PDW, and review the phase diagram of confined superfluid 3He.

Spatially-modulated superfluid phases in confined 3He: nucleation and crystallization of polka-dots

Superfluid 3He has provided a platform for studying new states of matter. It has been predicted that under strong confinement the planar-distorted B phase of superfluid 3He becomes unstable towards pair-density-wave (PDW), that is, crystalline-ordered superfluid. Here we study the possible PDW states in confined superfluid 3He. Using the Ginzburg-Landau theory incorporating strong coupling corrections, we find that two-dimensional PDW state is energetically competitive to one-dimensional PDW state. The two-dimensional PDW consists of a periodic array of two degenerate Balian-Werthamer domains. We find that as temperature increases, the periodic pattern changes from a brick-type texture to a polka-dot texture. Recent NMR measurement of superfluid confined to a nanoscale cavity have found evidence for a spatially modulated phase, which is neither the one-dimensional PDW phase nor the planar-distorted B phase [Levitin et al., PRL 122, 085301 (2019)]. In this talk, I will discuss a possible scenario to understand the experimental observations from the aspect of two-dimensional PDWs.
