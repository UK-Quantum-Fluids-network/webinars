The new academic yeaer will start with a webinar session on the density modulated phases of superfluid 3He. The speakers in this session ar Dr Lev Levitin 
from Royal Holloway University of London (title: "Search for Cooper pair density waves in superfluid helium 3"), and Prof. Takeshi Mizushima from Osaka University 
(title:"Spatially-modulated superfluid phases in confined 3He: nucleation and crystallization of polka-dots"). The session will start at 4pm with two 30min presentations.
The abstracts will be published here soon.
