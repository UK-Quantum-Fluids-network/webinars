We report on recent R&D work towards "HeRALD", a search for low-mass dark matter using a superfluid <sup>4</sup>He target.  Dark matter scatters within the 4He target may produce atomic recoils, detectable via roton quantum evaporation at the liquid surface.  Recent work has demonstrated a recoil energy threshold of ~200eV, which we expect to reduce dramatically to the eV or sub-eV scale in the coming year.  Although the long term goal of the project is to test dark matter models, our near-term efforts are focused on better understanding and optimizing the signal pathway:  roton production, propagation, reflection, and evaporation.
