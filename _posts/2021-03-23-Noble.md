Dr Theo Noble (Lancaster University) gives a webinar on "Catching Quantum Tornados - Nanoscale Real-Time Detection of Quantum Vortices at Millikelvin Temperatures" at 4:30pm UK time.

Quantum vortices are string-like defects in a quantum fluid. Many such vortices can form quantum turbulence which we can view as a tangle of vortex strings. Conceptually this is much simpler than classical turbulence, for which we still lack an effective theory for. Part of the challenge in comparing quantum and classical turbulence is studying quantum turbulence over the full range of associated length scales. Here we demonstrate vortex detection at the micro-scale using a nanobeam immersed in superfluid 4He at 10mK. By tracking the resonant frequency of the beam we can see in real time the capture, trapping and release of quantum vortices by the beam. By varying the vortex density of the vortex tangle we see how turbulence affects the vortex capture and release rates of the beam.
