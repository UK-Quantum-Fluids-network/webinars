Prof Kamran Behnia (ESPCI- Paris, FRANCE) gives a webinar on 'How heat propagates in normal liquid <sup>3</sup>He' (4PM UK time)

Chair: Dima Zmeev

<b>Abstract</b>

Landau’s theory of Fermi liquids was inspired by the case of liquid <sup>3</sup>He. Thermal conductivity of <sup>3</sup>He [1] conforms to this theory but contrary to a common belief, only at very low temperatures. The deviation from the expected temperature dependence can be explained by assuming that Landau’s quasi-particles are not the only players and there is another contribution to heat transport by a collective sound mode [2].  In the hydrodynamic limit when the scattering rate is larger than frequency, the celebrated zero sound [3] cannot be distinguished from the first sound. The empirical expression for this second channel of heat transport looks like a quantum version of the Bridgman equation for thermal conductivity of classical liquids [4]. A collective mode may also be relevant to transport in strongly correlated metallic Fermi liquids whose resistivity deviates from a quadratic behavior well below the Fermi degeneracy temperature.

  <figcaption>Figure 1: Thermal conductivity, <i>κ</i>, of liquid <sup>3</sup>He as reported by Greywall (at zero pressure) and by Murphy and Meyer (at saturated vapor pressure). At very low temperatures (<i>T</i> ~ 0.01 K) in the Fermi liquid regime, <i>κ</i> ∝ <i>T</i><sup> -1</sup> (purple line). Above 0.5 K, <i>κ</i> ∝ <i>T</i><sup>1/2</sup>. The red solid line represents a fit to the experimental data in the whole temperature range assuming that <i>κ</i> consists of the sum of the two terms. </figcaption>
