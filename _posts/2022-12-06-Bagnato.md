Prof Vanderlei Bagnato (Universidade de SÃ£o Paulo) talks about "Universal dynamics of a turbulent superfluid Bose gas".


We study the emergence of universal scaling in the time-evolving momentum distribution of a harmonically trapped three-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate, parametrically driven to a turbulent state. We demonstrate that the out-of-equilibrium dynamics post excitation is described by a single function due to nearby nonthermal fixed points. The observed behavior connects the dynamics of a quantum turbulent state to several far-fromequilibrium phenomena. We present a controllable protocol to explore universality in such systems, obtaining the associated scaling exponents. Our experimental results thus offer a promising route to investigate the complex dynamics of the quantum turbulent regime.
