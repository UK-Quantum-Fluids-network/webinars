Dr August Geelmuyden (Nottingham University) gives a webinar on "The sound-ring radiation of expanding vortex clusters" at 4pm UK time.
The abstract is below.


We investigate wave-vortex interaction emerging from an expanding compact vortex cluster in a two-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate. We adapt techniques developed for compact gravitational objects to derive the characteristic modes of the wave-vortex interaction perturbatively around an effective vortex flow field. We demonstrate the existence of orbits or sound-rings, in analogy to gravitational light-rings, and compute the characteristic spectrum for the out-of-equilibrium vortex cluster. The spectrum obtained from numerical simulations of a stochastic Gross-Pitaevskii equation exhibiting an expanding vortex cluster is in excellent agreement with analytical predictions. Our findings are relevant for 2d-quantum turbulence, the semi-classical limit around fluid flows, and rotating compact objects exhibiting discrete circulation.
