Tanja Rindler-Daller (University of Vienna) gives a webinar on 'Dark matter as self-gravitating BECs: another link between condensed
matter and gravity' at 4pm UK time.


Ultralight bosons have been prominent candidates for the resolution of
the cosmological dark matter problem.
If these bosons form a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), their dynamics
exemplifies differences to the standard model of cold dark matter,
whether it be the appearance of solitons or vortices in galactic halos,
or the formation of cosmic structures, in general. In this talk, I will
focus on the theory side of these dynamical aspects, but will also
discuss how signature effects can be identified or constrained, using
astronomical observations. Aside from the actual dark matter problem, I
will argue how the analysis of BEC dark matter might also contribute to
a better understanding of "quantum-gravity" issues.
