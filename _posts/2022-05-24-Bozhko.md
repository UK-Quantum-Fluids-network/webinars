Finding new ways for fast and efficient processing and transfer of data is one of the most challenging tasks nowadays. One of the most challenging directions in this area is quantum computing. Thus, it is very important to look for physical systems, which might become companions or even replacements for the current superconducting computing elements.


One of the possible solutions might come from the investigation of magnetic systems and quasiparticles associated with the elementary disturbance of magnetic order – magnons. Large tunability, relatively long lifetimes of excitations, intrinsic nonlinearities, excellent ability to connect to other physical systems and easy creation of macroscopic quantum states like magnon Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC) – these are some of the main features, which might be used for the advancement of quantum computing.


In this talk, I will summarize some of the main achievements in the field of quantum magnonics – magnon BEC and its excitations: supercurrents and Bogoliubov waves. Also, I will present a recently developed heralded single magnon source concept.
