Breakthrough experiments have newly explored the fascinating 
physics of dipolar quantum droplets and supersolids. 
The recent realization of dipolar mixtures opens further intriguing possibilities. 
We show that under rather general conditions, the presence of a 
second component catalyzes droplet nucleation and supersolidity 
in an otherwise unmodulated condensate. For miscible mixtures, 
droplet catalyzation results from the effective modification of the 
relative dipolar strength and may occur even for a surprisingly s
mall impurity doping. We show that different ground-states may 
occur, including the possibility of two coexisting interacting 
supersolids [1,2].
 
In addition, we predict the existence of a binary supersolid state 
in which the two components form a series of alternating domains, 
producing an immiscible double supersolid. Remarkably, we find 
that a dipolar component can even induce supersolidity in a 
nondipolar component. In stark contrast to single-component 
supersolids, the number of crystal sites is not strictly limited by 
the condensate populations, and the density is hence, substantially
 lower. Our results are applicable to a wide range of dipole moment 
combinations, marking an important step towards long-lived 
 bulk-supersolidity [3]as well as the possibility of studying polaron
 physics [4].
